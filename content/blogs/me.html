<p>Hi Kostis, I’m Keshav Mahendra from <em>Glasgow, Scotland</em>. I was born and brought up in the city, but I have spent time living in <em>Lucknow, India</em> and <em>Toronto, Canada</em>, moving with my father’s work.</p>
<p>I did my undergrad in maths at Lancaster University, where I specialised in pure maths, namely abstract algebra and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory">number theory</a>. I had a great time at the uni with a very diverse crowd.</p>
<p>Extracurricularly, I have unsurprisingly participated in a lot of maths competitions- primarily during secondary school where I won a few awards in them. I also enjoy playing badminton and going to the gym. I am a big fan of the Cleveland Browns in the NFL and Maclaren in Formula 1 (recently spending £100 on Maclaren merchendise, as a man who doesn’t typically spend money on clothes).</p>
<p>I’ve done a few internships in finance with one this past summer with a boutique in Liverpool Street called Peel Hunt LLP. That was an enjoyable experience and I am thoroughly considering going back.</p>
