The date variables are given as characters and need to be formatted as dates

# Creating a plot
We are creating a plot showing Joe Biden's net approval margin over time alond with its 95% confidence interval. The plot we are trying to recreate is the the one at the top of the webpage.

Now we shall use `ggplot` and its nuances on our dataset to replicate the above graph.

```{r poll_plot, cache=TRUE}
  
approval_polllist_ci<-approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(week_of_the_year=week(enddate),net_approval_rate=approve-disapprove)%>% #calculating the net approval rating
  filter(subgroup=="All polls") %>% #filtering for all polls
  group_by(week_of_the_year)%>% #grouping by week

            sd_net_approval_rate=sd(net_approval_rate),

             margin_of_error=t_critical*se_net_approval_rate,

            higher_ci_95=average_net_approval_rate+t_critical*se_net_approval_rate,
            na.rm=TRUE) %>% #calculating the confidence intervals for each week

# Comparing Confidence Intervals

The confidence intervals for `week 3` is very wide compared to the other weeks, whereas the confidence interval for `week 25` is narrower. The reason the confidence interval for week 3 is wide is because it is the first week we have data for and our data starts in the middle of the week. Week 3 in 2021 was from 18-24. January. The 'enddate' variable from the data set that we use to plot the weeks only starts from January 21st. Therefore, we believe the number of data points in week 3 to be much lower than in other weeks, leading to a wider confidence interval.
